  - ResourceLocator -> Resources/ResourceLocator.hpp
  - Stl -> Platform/Stl.hpp & StdLib.hpp
  - App/AppTimer -> Platform/Timer.hpp
  - App/AppUserInput -> Common
  - App/App.cpp -> ??? Has PeekMessage() etc, and PostQuitMessage()
  - Audio stuff XInput specific rather than Win10
  - Can main.cpp be Common, instead of Win10 specifc?
  - ? Logging -> Platform/Logging.hpp
  - ? ErrorHandling -> Platform/Result.hpp
  - ? Display -> Platform/Window.hpp
